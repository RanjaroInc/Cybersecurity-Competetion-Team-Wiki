## Career Change 

*Challenge Description: Sekrit is considering a new career, but is keeping it sekrit! There is a flag double-hidden somewhere at [sekrits](http://sekritskwerl.com/more_sekrits).*

We are given a URL of a web-page to examine (http://sekritskwerl.com/more_sekrits)   

The URL takes us to the homepage:

The other pages are as follows:

First attempt at finding the flag was checking for any hidden elements within the embedded images, those images being as follows:

[Reference for image forensics](https://scribe.bus-hit.me/beginners-ctf-guide-finding-hidden-data-in-images-e3be9e34ae0d)
Examining All three images with basic commands reveals nothing of value, so most likely the flag is not contained within any of these images
